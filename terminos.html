Article I - Interpretation

Section I.01 Defined Terms. All capitalized and undefined terms herein shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section I.04 Definitions. 
Section I.02 Parties. Any reference to a “Party” herein means you or Zendi, as the case may be, and a reference to the “Parties” means both you and Zendi.

Article II. ZENDI SERVICE DISCLAIMERS


Section II.01 Important Information: In alignment with efforts to combat terrorism financing and money laundering, federal regulations mandate that all financial institutions acquire, validate, and document information identifying each individual who establishes an account.
Section II.02 For you, this entails: Upon initiating the process to open an account with us, we will request specific details such as names, addresses, dates of birth, or other relevant information to verify the identity of individuals or the legitimacy of entities.

Article III. MANDATES. 
Section III.01. Under this Contract, the Client authorizes Zendi to:

If we detect the existence of more than one account in the name of the same Client, we reserve the right to suspend or cancel one or all of the accounts linked to the services covered by these Terms and Conditions, with Zendi notice to the corresponding Client. As a prerequisite to the use of the platform, Clients must have accepted our personal data processing policy and, specifically, must have authorized the processing of their data in accordance with the provisions of said policy.
Article V -  PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATE).
Section V.01 The User and Zendi (together, the "Parties") may from time to time enter into specific destination mandates for Payment Instructions (each a "Payment Instruction Request") through which Zendi provides payment dispersion services.
Section V.02 Upon completing a Payment Instruction Request, the User grants Zendi an irrevocable specific destination mandate that includes the following specific tasks: (i) to pay on behalf and order a certain sum of money in relation to which the Payment Instruction Request is completed; (ii) to collect the Funds on their behalf and order, subject to the Terms and Conditions of the Payment Instruction Service; and (iii) other gateway service functionalities that do not contravene the aggregator service.
Section V.03 It is possible to enter into a specific destination mandate granted by the User, which implies an authorization to dispose on their behalf of certain funds and transfer the Funds to a certain recipient by crediting a designated Account according to their instructions.
Section V.04 Zendi will not use the User's Funds for purposes other than those instructed by the User.
Section V.05 The User enters into the Payment Instruction Request by completing an online Payment Instruction Request form detailing the instructions regarding the Funds.
Section V.06 Zendi reserves the right to not process those Payment Instruction Requests that are incomplete or in which there are discrepancies between the data provided by the Users and the data actually entered into  Zendi or because Zendi deems it necessary, without needing to justify its decision.
Section V.07 The User is solely responsible for the payment instructions and their consequences.
Section V.08 Zendi will not verify the cause or obligation that originated the payment instruction, nor any other circumstances related to the payment instruction. Payment instructions entered in a Payment Instruction Request can only be executed through the platform, and no instruction sent by other means unrelated to the platform will be processed or considered valid. Additionally, Zendi adheres to all applicable Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Client/Business (KYC/KYB) procedures. As part of these procedures, additional documents or explanations may be requested from the user. The user is solely responsible for providing these documents and must inform Zendi beforehand about the purpose of the transaction.
Section V.09 The Payment Instruction Request will not be considered complete, and  Zendi will not assume any responsibility or obligation under the Payment Instruction Request until (i)  Zendi has accepted the User's Payment Instruction Request (it is clarified that  Zendi may refuse to comply with the Payment Instruction Request without giving any reason or cause and therefore will not be liable in any way), and (ii) the total amount of Funds have been received and are available.

Article XIII. FUND TRANSFERS  


Section XIII.01 Clarification of Communication with Zendi: It is important to understand that direct communication with Zendi regarding any concerns or reports of unauthorized transactions does not imply that Zendi is engaged in, or responsible for, conducting licensed financial activities. The user hereby accepts and recognizes that Zendi is not a licensed company and uses licensed partner institutions to carry out regulated financial activities. Such communications serve solely to facilitate the initial reporting process. As a technology service provider, Zendi’s role in this context is to promptly relay your concerns to our licensed partner institutions responsible for carrying out the regulated activities. Zendi acts as an intermediary to ensure that your reports are addressed efficiently by the appropriate entities in accordance with our operational protocols and partnership agreements.
Section XIII.02 Immediate Reporting Required: If you suspect that an electronic fund transfer has been conducted without your authorization, it is imperative that you inform Zendi immediately. The most efficient method to minimize potential losses is through prompt telephonic communication. The risk of losing all the funds in your account exists if action is not taken swiftly. By notifying Zendi within one business day after recognizing any unauthorized transaction, your loss will be limited to no more than $50. Failure to report unauthorized use within this timeframe may increase your liability up to $500, provided Zendi demonstrates that timely notification on your part could have prevented the unauthorized access to your funds.
Furthermore, should your account statement indicate transactions that you did not authorize, it is crucial to alert Zendi promptly. A failure to report these discrepancies within 30  days of the statement's mailing date may result in an inability to recover funds lost subsequent to this period. However, should extenuating circumstances, such as travel or hospitalization, when adequately supported,  prevent timely communication, these deadlines may be extended to accommodate your situation.
For detailed information on the roles of Zendi and its licensed partner institutions in facilitating these transactions, as well as updates on our licensing agreements, please refer to our legal page at https://zendi.tech
Section XIII.03 Contact in the Event of Unauthorized Transfer. If you suspect any unauthorized electronic fund transfer from your account, immediately contact us at: contact@zendi.tech or 702.813.3800, or address your concerns in writing to Zendi at 16192 Coastal Highway, Lewes, DE 19958, County of Sussex, Delaware, USA. For detailed information on our operational framework and partnership with licensed institutions, please visit our legal page at https://zendi.tech
Section XIII.04 Business Days. For the purpose of these disclosures, our business days are Monday through Friday, excluding public holidays.
Section XIII.05 Confidentiality. Zendi may disclose information about your account or the transfers you make to third parties where necessary for completing transfers; to verify the existence and condition of your account with entities like credit bureaus or merchants; to comply with government agency or court orders; or when you provide us with your explicit written consent. By accepting these terms, you grant Zendi full and unlimited authorization to share the necessary information with all our service providers, partners, and companies within our group to facilitate your use of our services, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, or enhance your experience. This sharing of information will always be conducted with strict adherence to our Privacy Policy, ensuring your data is protected according to the highest security standards.
Section XIII.06 Documentation. You will receive monthly account statements electronically, unless no transfers occur within a month, in which case, statements will be sent at least quarterly.
Article XIV. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION'S LIABILITY
Section XIV.01 While Zendi acts as a facilitator by connecting clients with licensed partners for financial transactions, it is essential to recognize that the liability for any failed or incorrect transfers is determined by the terms of the agreement directly between the client and the licensed financial institution. In some instances, such agreements may be executed by Zendi on behalf of the client, or through similar arrangements, ensuring transactions are carried out under the specified terms. Exceptions to liability include, but are not limited to: insufficient funds in the client’s account, known system malfunctions at the time of initiating the transfer, and extraordinary circumstances beyond reasonable control.
Section XIV.02 Zendi will not be responsible for orders, instructions, Payment Instruction Requests, and/or wrong or incomplete payments caused by the erroneous entry of the e-mail, relevant information of the recipient, or the payment operation, made by the User.

Section XIV.04 The User acknowledges and agrees that by conducting transactions with other Users or third parties, they do so at their own will, freely giving their consent and under their own risk and responsibility. In no case will Zendi be responsible for lost profits, or for any other damage and/or loss that the User may have suffered due to transactions made or not made through the Zendi platform. The user acknowledges that the services provided are not an instrument to generate foreign currency abroad bypassing the foreing exchange rules. 
Section XIV.05 Since Zendi is unrelated to the obligation that gave rise to the Payment Instruction Request,  Zendi will not be responsible or verify the causes, amount, or any other circumstance related to such Request, as well as regarding the existence, quality, quantity, functioning, condition, integrity, or legitimacy of the goods or services offered, acquired, or disposed of by the Users and paid using Zendi, as well as the capacity to contract of the Users and the truthfulness of the personal data they have entered.
In the event that one or more Users or a third party initiate any type of claim or legal actions against another or other Users, all and each of the Users involved in such claims or actions exempt all responsibility to the market.
Section XIV.06 In no event shall we be liable for any act, error, or omission of third parties or Commercial Partners, including, without limitation, any service or product advertised through the Site, or the non-compliance of any third party in relation to the services advertised or available through the platform.
Section XIV.07 We are not responsible for any damage, injury, or loss caused by failures in the platform arising from the server, intermittencies in the service, or the availability of the Internet. Nor will we be responsible for any virus that may infect the Clients' equipment as a result of accessing or using the platform or as a result of any transfer of data, files, images, texts, or audio contained therein. Clients may not attribute any responsibility or demand payment for lost profits, as a result of technical difficulties or failures in the Internet systems. We do not guarantee continuous or uninterrupted access to and use of our platform beyond what is indicated in the Service Level Agreements.
Section XIV.08 The platform may occasionally be unavailable due to technical difficulties or Internet failures, or due to any other circumstance beyond our control; with the understanding that we will strive to restore it as quickly as possible, without this being attributable to us as any type of liability.

As such, our clients grant Evia a Specific Mandate to issue dispersal orders. Upon each request for a transaction by the client, a framework agreement is established, enabling Evia to perform one or several fund dispersal operations ("the dispersion"). This includes taking all necessary actions to effectuate the dispersion, which may involve engaging third-party service providers to participate in various stages of the dispersion process.

Clients are required to provide the funds intended for dispersion, in accordance with the instructions provided to Evia. These funds may be delivered in one or multiple transactions, as specified by the client, either on a continuous or ad hoc basis. Evia, in its role as the Agent, commits to receiving these funds solely for the purpose of executing the assigned dispersals, strictly adhering to the client’s instructions.
