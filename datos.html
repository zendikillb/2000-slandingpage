Introduction
‍
KillB and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (“KillB”, “we”, “our”, “us”) understand and respect our users’ need for privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) explains how KillB collects, uses, and shares information we collect about you when you use our Website (www.killb.com), mobile applications, browser extension, payment processing services, application programming interfaces, and other online products and services that link to this privacy notice (collectively, our “Services”), contact our customer service team, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us or our Services.
We may change this privacy notice from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this notice and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this privacy notice regularly to stay informed about our information handling practices and the choices available to you.
‍
‍How We Collect Your Information
‍
Information We Collect From Our Website
‍Information You Provide to Us
‍
We collect the information you provide directly to us. For example, you can provide information directly to us when you create a KillB account, use our Services to send and receive money or cryptocurrency or to buy and sell cryptocurrency, request access to or use certain features, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect about you include your name and contact information (such as email address, postal address, and phone number), date of birth, username, profile image, photograph, payment and transaction hashes (including blockchain addresses), identity information you submit (such as government-issued identification numbers, photos of government-issued documents, and proof of address), passcode, payment and financial account information (including payment method information and bank account and routing numbers), transaction information (including information about other parties to the transaction), and any other information you choose to provide.To open a business account with KillB, we may require you to provide additional information about you and the beneficial owners of the business. The types of additional information we may collect for business accounts include business name, physical address, mailing address, proof of address, tax ID, name of beneficial owner(s), proof of legal formation (for example, a Certificate of Incorporation), bank statement, bank account information, and name and contact information of employees authorized to act on behalf of the business.

Information We Collect Automatically When You Interact with Us
‍
When you use or interact with our Services, we may automatically collect certain information, including:
‍
- Transactional Information
When you transfer, purchase, or sell cryptocurrency or make or receive a payment, we collect information about the transaction, such as the transaction amount, the date of the transaction, the transaction origination and destination (including any address information), and, in some cases, the identity and contact information of the other party to your transaction.
‍
- Device Information
We collect information about your device when you interact with our Services, including the hardware model, operating system version, mobile network, IP address, device identifier, browser type, and app version.
‍
- Location Information
We infer your approximate geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) based on your IP address.
‍
- Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies
We (and our service providers) use tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect information about you. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us provide and improve our Services and your experience, such as by allowing us to see which areas and features of our Services are popular, store preferences, and help protect our systems and users. Web beacons (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) are electronic images that we use on our Services and in our emails to help deliver cookies, count visits, and understand usage and campaign effectiveness.

Information We Collect from Other Sources

We collect information about you (and the other party to a transaction) from third-party sources. For example, we may collect this information from identity verification and know-your-customer service providers, financial services providers, and financial institutions, including information such as name, username, phone number, postal address, transaction confirmations, age, government-issued identification numbers (such as Social Security number), and financial account information (including account balances and transaction history).

This information may include transaction descriptions that relate to you or your name or username.
‍
Information We Derive
‍
Finally, we may also derive information or draw inferences about you based on the information we collect. For example, as noted above, we may make inferences about your location based on your IP address, we may infer that certain products or services may be of interest to you based on your transaction history, and we may draw inferences about potential fraudulent activity.
